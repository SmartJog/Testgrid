Test Grid
=========

Introduction
------------

The testgrid is a service designed to facilitate the validation of software deliverables by offering a flexible, programmable and user-friendly deployment environment.
Its usage is simple: indicate which deliverable (or set of deliverable you wish to deploy), and possibly which version, and the service will ensure the allocation of the host(s), the installation of the deliverable independently of its type (debian package, IS image, ansible script, ...), ensure its isolation (including for interconnected hosts) and offer an interface to access it.
This environment is dedicated to testing and ensure the following properties: isolation (at most one deliverable per host (physical or virtual), subnetting for interconnected hosts), dedicated users, and the possibility to install multiple versions of the same deliverable.
